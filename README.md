# Data-I-O-2020-Team-BuckeyeData-

My team and I took on the challenge of drawing insights from the NFL Play by Play Dataset which consisted of data from 2009-2018 seasons, which can be found on kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/maxhorowitz/nflplaybyplay2009to2016?select=NFL+Play+by+Play+2009-2017+%28v4%29.csv

We focused on the problem of how to come up with a way for defenses to predict the play an offense would run next, given the current situation of the game.
